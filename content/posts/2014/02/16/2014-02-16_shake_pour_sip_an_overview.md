status: draft

Go to a cocktail bar -- a fancy one. Watch the tender make your drink. Now go to a different bar and watch again. Maybe hit a third.

How many ways did you just see a canister full of liquor and ice get shaken?

If you asked your bartender about how they made the drink, you probably got a lot of... "information." You now know not to bruise your gin, whatever that means, and an explanation about why you should always set your citrus on fire over a drink, and who-knows-what other claptrap. I'm not trying to imply that cocktails are trivial to make -- far from it. Making a good cocktail requires attention and care, and very good technique. But no superstition -- and you certainly aren't going to "bruise" your gin. My assertion is this: with a clear head about how to execute a couple of basics, you can clear up a lot of what's bad about most bar drinks and start learning about what you like.

Without further adieu, I present my very own Cocktail Technique 101.

### Measuring

Why anybody still scoffs at measuring out cocktail ingredients I have no idea. All the best bars I've been to measure their ingredients, and you should, too. You'll be surprised how much mystery this clears up. Drink too sweet? Cut the sugar in half. Martini too dry, or not dry enough? Produce a consistent, reproducible modification, then _write it down_ so you can remember what you did. Making a great cocktail has nothing to do with counting seconds from a speed pour; it has a lot to do with knowing that a good Manhattan base is 2 ounces of rye and 0.75 ounces of sweet vermouth.

### Combining

"Shaken or stirred?" is a surprisingly easy question. It goes like this:

> Would you like to be able to see through the drink you just made? Then stir it. If not, or if it doesn't matter, shake the bazoley out of it.

...that's it. You're done. Well, okay -- there are a few edge cases, like the Brandy Alexander, where you **must** shake to generate the foamy head that makes the drink special. But all of the edge cases pass the first and most important test: is it clear? In practice, "clear" means "contains neither fruit juice nor milk nor eggs." Martini? Stir that -- you'll get a crystalline drink to present in your best stemware. Mai tai? Shake it like... like...

Well shake it like this:
1. Measure your ingredients in to a pint glass.
2. Dump a bunch of ice in to your Boston Shaker (the metal cup you always see bartenders use).
3. Pour the liquid in to the metal cup, then put the pint glass in to the shaker to form a complete vessel.
4. Thump the butt of the pint glass, soundly, with your open palm or fist. You need to make a seal.
5. Pick this up and shake it. Shake it as hard as you can. There is no right or wrong way to do this, so long as you are shaking with as much violence as you can muster. Seriously -- fancy patterns and weird rhythms are all stagecraft. What you want to do is shake this thing like something terrible will happen if you don't shake hard enough. I like to place a palm on each end of the capsule, because I feel more confident when I can hold both halves together. Remember: rapidly cooling the inside of this canister is going to reduce the volume of the ingredients and air, as well as causing the metal shaker to contract -- all of which work to make the seal you're going to be relying on to keep the drink _inside_ the shaker. This means: don't dawdle.
6. Shake until the metal gets unconfortably cold to touch and/or frost forms.
7. To open: place the shaker down on the counter, firmly, metal half down. Place one hand along the side of the canister and hold it firmly. With your other hand, smack the outisde of the metal shaker at about the place the pint glass is stuck in to it. If you do this right, you should hear the sucking sound of a vacuum being released, and the top of the shaker should come off easily.

Stirring is considerably easier and more peaceful:
1. Put ice in a pint glass
2. Measure your ingredients over the ice
3. Stir with a bar spoon until everything is really cold.
4. Feel pretty smug you aren't shaking this thing.

### Strain

This is gonna sound silly, but here it is: when I get a cocktail in a bar, and I take a sip of it, the first thing that hits me is how well strained it was -- _especially_ if the drink was a) shaken and b) served up. Shaking generates tiny chips of ice, and there simply isn't a Hawthorne strainer on this Earth that will remove them. Instead, an incautiously strained drink will have a layer of ice that float on top of the drink, bump against your lips as you sip, spoil the texture of the cocktail, and slowly dilute it too far.

Avoiding this problem is ridiculously simple:
1. Did you stir your drink? Strain by placing a Julep Spoon down in to the pint glass. Done.
2. Was the drink shaken? Place a Hawthorne strainer on top of your shaker. Now, pour the drink through a small, fine strainer. If the drink is thick -- an Alexander or a Sour, for instance -- you can speed the drinks passage through the strainer by tapping the strainer with the end of the shaker.

### Accessorize

By now, you should have something delicious in a glass. This is good news! You're almost there. Last thing you need is to make sure the whole works is tied together. Let's talk trimmings.

It should be noted that many drinks don't need a damn thing, and as you make your own cocktails, you should ask about what your final addition is really _doing_ for the drink. Here's a first rule: aesthetics are very important, but I prefer things that add a flavor or aroma that completes the drink. An Old Fashioned _without_ a little sweet orange flavor? Not as good. On the other hand, I'll drink an un-garnished Martini. The flavor of a Sazerac is so tight and dense that I think a little citrus zest is crucial. A Remember the Maine gets cherries because they are nice to eat -- by the time you've made the drink, it should be so infused with cherry-ness that the cherries take flavor from the _drink_, not the other way around.

There's a word I've been trying not to say: "garnish." "Garnish" brings to mind sprigs of parsley -- little piles of dross that get added just for the visual appeal. Certainly, I've had plenty of garnished cocktails. Rum drinks, in particular, often come with "flags" of fruit -- essentially a fruit side-salad on a skewer -- that I'd be hard-pressed to say I "enjoy." The visual appeal of your drink _is_ very important. My philosophy is: achieve pleasing aesthetics with good serving glasses and well-chosen _accoutrement_ (straws, etc); consider garnish an ingredient, and like any other ingredient, only use what truly improves the flavor of the drink.

Whew. Okay. Rant done -- I feel better, thanks. Let's talk about using zest: this is another place where you're going to see a thousand different techniques. There are only a couple things to make sure of:

1. Use fresh citrus.
2. Do your zesting over the drink. You'll be surprised how much citrus oil is released as you cut the fruit.
3. If you're making a fancy shape from your zest, do that over the drink, too. Always find some way to squeeze or stretch the zest over the beverage.
4. Run the zest around the edge of the glass before settling it in to the drink.

How fancy you want to get with shaping/skewering/whatever-ing your zest is entirely a question of preference and aesthetics. Me? I use a sharp vegetable peeler to cut a wide swath of zest -- I find it attractive and easy to handle.

Last point: don't drop small things loose in to your drinks. Yes, I know, this is done all the time -- a lone cherry sitting in the bottom of your Manhattan, which was probably served in a martini glass. Personally, I can't stand having something that isn't ice rattling around in my cocktail. If the drink is served up, I don't want to choke on some loose bit of Stuff; if the drink is served over, I don't want to have to go fishing if I decide I want to eat whatever was dropped in there. The moral of this story is: put your cherry/olive/onion/candied ginger/salted plum/what-have-you on a toothpick or skewer.

### In Conclusion

Look, here's the deal: a cocktail has very few moving pieces. And spirits are easy ingredients to work with: a bottle of Maker's Mark is almost 100% guaranteed to taste like every other bottle of Maker's Mark you ever buy. This means that if you have consistent technique, you can control nearly all of the variation between one cocktail you make and the next. And _that_ gives you the room to figure out how to make the drinks that are exactly what you want to drink. Solid technique is the foundation of improvisation -- and that's where this stuff gets good!

Now what are you waiting for? Go make a drink!
