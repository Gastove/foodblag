Summary:
status: draft


When I was little, my father taught me how to cook.

...okay, that's not strictly true. Or even... approximately true. My father is an incredible man; I have no right to his story, except at the intersection of my own. And the truth of the matter is that I was taught the 'how's and 'what's of cooking by my mother. My mother taught me young and thoroughly that cooking is a show of care, among the more genuine ways to tell somebody, "you have a seat, you're loved here." And from my mother, I got a second part, too. To quote her directly, "sometimes I just have to sit back and make 'yummy' noises." Indirectly quoting now: "I love you, and this is going to taste _awesome_."

You know, though, that's an intersection between my father and mother -- one of the rare ones they shared, though unintentionally. While my mother loves food, my father is less than excited by it, most of the time. And yet: when my mother wound up with the lion's share of custody over my sister and I, my father ate pizza until sick of it, cooked mac'n'cheese until he never wanted to touch it again, even took us out to -- I'm not making this up -- Red Lobster. Fun facts: my father doesn't much like pizza, and probably hasn't had either mac'n'cheese or Red Lobster since the last time my sister or I forced them on him.

It took me until my twenties to figure that out. The guy was so hellbent on seeing my sister and I eat something we liked for dinner that we never caught on to his preferences. Same message as my mom; totally different packaging.

...but of course, my father did teach me to cook on a campfire, though a series of colorful assertions. He called them, -- wait, no, we need a better setup.

Do you know my father? Probably not -- he's shy as can be, and like I said, his story is for the most part not mine. But I can tell you he's quiet, an intellectual. Visualize me, but thinner and a little shorter. Tweed jacket, sweater vest, a cigar. North of twenty published novels.

And he used to teach me recipes from Bubba Donaldson's School of Campfire Cookin'. Here's my favorite:

##### Bubba Donaldson's Camp Fire Scrambled Eggs:
1. Crush eggs in your fists
2. Hold your fists in the fire.

Right? I love these things. Maybe it's a little tricky to tell what I learned here, tho. Let's try another one:

##### Bubba Donaldson's How to Boil Water at Camp:
1. Oh, it'll boil.

Now, I grew up being taken to camp, and I'm grateful for it. I was being told... uh, no. My father was asserting this stuff to me while I was being trotted off hither and yon for sleepovers, day camps, and the like. And somehow, my father's stories got this idea into my head: _I can cook that. I can make that work. I can figure that out. I can do that... outdoors._

And I have. Several times.

In the Desolation Wilderness outside Tahoe I fried falafels at 7K feet of elevation. In the mountains of New Mexico I've made omelets to order. In southern California, I made a _pasta carbonara_. I've done this stuff. It's kinda awesome. My partner and I went camping in Big Sur -- planned to get dinner at a restaurant, but that plan fell through. Scrambling for eatables, we wound up with potato, onion, mushroom, butter, aluminum foil... and hot dogs. And a fire pit. With a coarse iron grate and no implements.

...so I grilled hot dogs using my travel chopsticks while my partner made foil-packet veggies. Like bosses.
