Summary: When I was little, my father taught me how to cook.


When I was little, my father taught me how to cook.

...okay, that's not strictly true. Or even... approximately true. My father is an incredible man; I have no right to his story, except at the intersection of my own. And the truth of the matter is that I was taught the 'how's and 'what's of cooking by my mother. My mother taught me young and thoroughly that cooking is a show of care, among the more genuine ways to tell somebody, "have a seat, you're loved here." And from my mother, I got a second part, too. To quote her directly, "sometimes I just have to sit back and make 'yummy' noises." Indirectly quoting now: "I love you, and this is going to taste _awesome_."

You know, though, that's an intersection between my father and mother -- one of the rare ones they shared, though unintentionally. While my mother loves food, my father is less than excited by it, most of the time. And yet: when my mother wound up with the lion's share of custody over my sister and I, my father ate pizza until sick of it, cooked mac'n'cheese until he never wanted to touch it again, even took us out to -- I'm not making this up -- Red Lobster. Fun facts: my father doesn't much like pizza, and probably hasn't had either mac'n'cheese or Red Lobster since the last time my sister or I forced them on him. But he _loved_ us, and he wanted us to eat something _we_ liked, and he put us first.

It took me until my twenties to figure that out. The guy was so hellbent on seeing my sister and I eat something we liked for dinner that we (or at least I) never caught on to his preferences. Same message as my mom; totally different packaging.

The closest my father came to teaching me to cook was a series of recipes he'd declare from time to time. He called them-- wait, no, we need a better setup.

Do you know my father? Probably not -- he's shy as can be, and like I said, his story isn't mine to tell you. I'll tell you that he's quiet, an intellectual, plays bridge very well. Visualize me, but thinner and a half-foot shorter. Tweed jacket, sweater vest, a cigar. North of twenty published novels. His idea of "roughing it" is "a condo with not very many restaurants near by."

And he used to "teach" me recipes from Bubba Donaldson's School of Campfire Cookin'. Here's my favorite:

##### Bubba Donaldson's Camp Fire Scrambled Eggs:
1. Crush eggs in your fists.
2. Hold your fists in the fire.

Right? I love these things. Maybe it's a little tricky to tell what I learned here, though. Let's try another one:

##### Bubba Donaldson's How to Boil Water at Camp:
1. Oh, it'll boil.

Here am I, as enthusiastic an eater as I know. And here is my father, who would have cheerfully stopped eating years ago if he could. We're alike in so many ways -- a taste for Wagner and long words and shirts in solid colors. Food is one of the few places where we are from each other distant, and I think we feel that acutely.

Next week I'm going to turn thirty, I've decided -- it's about time. My father is coming to town, and like always, he wants to take me out to dinner. This might be the most challenging thing we do together; food isn't something we can easily share. The mechanics are different, I now see; when I cook for a person, part of the joy is in the sharing -- while from my father, the gift of food is more discrete, like a book or a watch or a TV. And we butt heads. My favorite dinner parties are a delight to every participant, while to him the whole point of the gift he wants to give is that this meal should be what _I and only I_ want. If I ask him what he'd like best, we're already at odds.

And yet, this core remains true: damn does that man love me, and he wants to feed me to show it, and I get kinda choked up about it when I think about it too long. Because when I was little, my father helped to teach me to speak love through food.

I love you too, Dad.
