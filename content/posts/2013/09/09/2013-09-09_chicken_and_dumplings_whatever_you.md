Summary: It will be delicious, practically no matter what.

I'm prone to carbs. I've untangled them from my diet here and there, but it's a push and a pull. I skip one to eat the next, budgeting a place in my diet for sourdough, good beer, tagliatele. Day to day, I eat well, I feel well, am happy and healthy.

Sometimes, I'm not healthy.

There's a set of foods I go to when my health wavers. Mostly, they make me feel worse, so I try to avoid them. (After all, what could be better for sickness than drinking ginger ale until you're ill from sugar?) There are three exceptions -- foods I can eat and recover, get healthier. Spicy chicken soup with noodles. Grilled cheese on sourdough with tomato soup. And the apex of comfort foods: stewed chicken with parsley dumplings.

It's a family recipe; the notes I have from my mother came from her mother, equal parts anecdote and measures. The idea is simple: a chicken is cut into pieces, floured, browned in fat, removed. Onions go in to the fat, then the chicken again but now with sage and cider vinegar and stock. As it cooks, you make a simple batter of flour and milk, made lighter and brighter with parsley. The dumplings cook floating on top of the broth and the chicken, the lid on tight. My sister and I between us ate so many dumplings that the recipe contains a note advising a triple batch, almost more dumplings than you can fit in a pot with a chicken. We still used to run out of dumplings before meat.

There are so few ways this can go wrong. Here are all of them:

1. Use an electric mixer on the dumplings. You'll knock them silly; they'll fight back by being impossible to chew.
2. Use crappy chicken stock. Seriously, if you don't have your own on hand (I frequently don't), get a jar of Better than Bouillon.
3. Cook it too long.

...that's it. The dumpling ingredients are less flexible than those of the stewed chicken, but you can swap parsley for about any other fresh herb you like (sage is very good), or you can omit it entirely. You can use more onion, add garlic, leave both out all together, more vinegar or less, bay or no bay. I grew up eating dumplings made with vegetable shortening; I prefer making them with lard or schmaltz. It's remarkably easy going.

I spent the weekend sick with stomach things and today I craved Real Food -- something I could eat and feel better, something easy to digest. I did the worst job I could making chicken and dumplings. I forgot the onion entirely; my chicken was frozen solid; I put the pieced chicken in with the whole frozen chicken so it all cooked at different speeds. But I didn't do any of the three mistakes above, and you know what?

My dinner was *delicious*.

Try this:

### Ingredients
*The Stewed Chicken:*

- 1 whole chicken, cut in to pieces.
- 1 onion
- 2 teaspoons sage
- 1/4 cup cider vinegar
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/4 cup white flour
- Oil or fat for low-temperature frying

*The Dumplings:*

- 2 cups white flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup parsley
- 2 tablespoons shortening, very cold
- 1 cup milk

You'll need: a single large pot. I use a big ol' Dutch oven.

### Directions
1. If your chicken comes whole, cut it in to pieces -- legs, each in two pieces, wings, breasts removed from the back and split.
2. Your oil: use anything you can fry the chicken pieces in. I like schmaltz best for this. Heat it in the pot on something medium-ish.
3. While the oil heats, toss the chicken pieces in salt, black pepper, and the quarter-cup flour.
4. Fry the chicken pieces in the oil; don't crowd them. Brown the pieces, pulling them out and resting them as needed.
5. Slice the onion into thick rings. Toss it into the fat.
6. Once the onion is soft, add the chicken back in, along with the stock, vinegar, sage, and bay.
7. Simmer. I give mine twentyish minutes of gentle simmering before I leap back into action.
8. Time for dumplings! Combine everything but the shortening and milk. Your herbs should be chopped; I go for something just north of 'fine'.
9. Toss the shortening in; using your fingertips, rub the fat into the dry ingredients until it looks like coarse meal. This takes very little time.
10. Using a spoon, stir the milk in to the dumpling dough. Stir pretty firmly; mix until just smooth. Add a little extra milk as you go if you need to. Don't go too far; err on the side of too little.
11. Check the chicken. Using tongs, grab one of the drumsticks; with the tip of a paring knife, give it a poke. You want little to no resistance.
12. Is the chicken set? Awesome. Using a spoon, dollop golf-ball-sized blobs of dough into the pot. Work quickly; go for even coverage. I start at the outside and work my way around toward the middle. Once all the dough is in, put the lid back on.
13. In ten minutes (ish), take the lid back off. The dumplings should be big and poofy and irresistible. A straw or toothpick poked in to the middle should come out clean.
14. Oh my. It's done.

Serve this in huge bowls -- a dumpling or two and a piece of chicken. Spoon broth over it. Eat this when it's too cold to be outside without a hat and sweater, or when it's raining, or when you need to feel human again. Make it for people you really love. Eat it and be happy.
