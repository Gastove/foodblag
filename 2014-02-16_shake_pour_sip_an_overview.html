	<p>Go to a cocktail bar -- a fancy one. Watch the tender make your drink. Now go to a different bar and watch again. Maybe hit a third.</p>
<p>How many ways did you just see a canister full of liquor and ice get shaken?</p>
<p>If you asked your bartender about how they made the drink, you probably got a lot of... "information." You now know not to bruise your gin, whatever that means, and an explanation about why you should always set your citrus on fire over a drink; you've probably gotten at least one diatribe about ice cubes, another about the <em>actual</em> origin of the Martini, and who-knows-what else.</p>
<p>Look: I'm not trying to suggest that cocktails are skill-free to make -- far from it. Bartending is a craft. Making a good cocktail requires attention and care and good technique. My assertion is this: with a clear head about how to execute a couple of basics, you can clear up a lot of what's bad about most mixed drinks and start learning about what you like. I also assert that the waters have been muddied by a combination of superstition, lore, and "we've always done it this way so we'd better make up a story to explain it" issues.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, I present my very own Cocktail Technique 101.</p>
<h3>Measuring</h3>
<p>Here is the bit of bartending misinformation that rankles me the most:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Real bartenders just know how much to pour. Measuring ingredients is, therefore, the sign of an amateur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, in a word, wrong. There are only two reasons to value just-pouring over measuring: measuring is marginally slower; if you skip measuring, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMXkiX9Hr_o">flair bartend</a>. There is nothing in the world wrong with being behind the bar at a nightclub and needing to pour twelve thousand long-island iced teas for a sea of glitteratti. It's also not, I argue, the most reliable way to make consistent craft cocktails. Put another way: I measure my ingredients, all of my favorite bars measure their ingredients, and you should measure your ingredients, too.</p>
<p>You'll be surprised how much mystery this clears up. Drink too sweet? Cut the sugar in half. Martini too dry, or not dry enough? Produce a consistent, reproducible modification, then <em>write it down</em> so you can remember what you did. Making a great cocktail has nothing to do with counting seconds from a speed pour; it has a lot to do with knowing that a good Manhattan base is 2 ounces of rye and 0.75 ounces of sweet vermouth, and knowing that's exactly how much of each ingredient is in your glass.</p>
<p>Also worth considering: cocktails are one of the only things you'll ever make in a kitchen that can be <em>exactly</em> the same every time you make them. A bottle of Maker's Mark is just shy of certain to taste like every other bottle of Maker's Mark you ever buy, ever. This means that you, the bartender, have nearly perfect control over every variable in your drink. If you have reliable measuring, then everything you change happens on purpose. Now my friend: that is bartending.</p>
<p>Suggestion: measure with <a href="http://www.oxo.com/p-510-mini-angled-measuring-cup.aspx">one of these</a>. They aren't particularly pretty, but they're cheap as can be and incredibly easy to use well.</p>
<h3>Combining</h3>
<p>"Shaken or stirred?" is a surprisingly easy question. It goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you like to be able to see through the drink you just made? Then stir it. If not, or if it doesn't matter, shake the bazoley out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...that's it. You're done. Well, okay -- there are a few edge cases, like the Brandy Alexander, where you <strong>must</strong> shake to give the drink the texture that makes it special (ditto anything with egg whites). But all of the edge cases pass the first and most important test: is it clear? In practice, "clear" means "contains neither fruit juice nor milk nor eggs." Martini? Stir that -- you'll get a crystalline drink to present in your best stemware. Mai Tai? Shake it like... like...</p>
<p>Well shake it like this:
1. Measure your ingredients in to a pint glass.
2. Dump a bunch of ice in to your Boston Shaker (the metal cup you always see bartenders use).
3. Pour the liquid in to the metal cup, then put the pint glass in to the shaker to form a complete vessel.
4. Thump the butt of the pint glass, soundly, with your open palm or fist. You need to make a seal.
5. Pick this up and shake it. Shake it as hard as you can. There is no right or wrong way to do this, so long as you are shaking with as much violence as you can muster. Seriously -- fancy patterns and weird rhythms are all stagecraft. What you want to do is shake this thing like something terrible will happen if you don't shake hard enough. I like to place a palm on each end of the capsule, because I feel more confident when I can hold both halves together. Remember: rapidly cooling the inside of this canister is going to reduce the volume of the ingredients and air, as well as causing the metal shaker to contract -- all of which work to make the seal you're going to be relying on to keep the drink <em>inside</em> the shaker. This means: don't dawdle.
6. Shake until the metal gets unconfortably cold to touch and/or frost forms.
7. To open: place the shaker down on the counter, metal half down. Place one hand along the side of the canister and hold it firmly. With your other hand, smack the outisde of the metal shaker at about the place the pint glass is stuck in to it. If you do this right, you should hear the sucking sound of a vacuum being released, and the top of the shaker should come off easily.</p>
<p>Stirring is considerably easier and more peaceful:
1. Put ice in a pint glass
2. Measure your ingredients over the ice
3. Stir with a bar spoon until everything is really cold.
4. Feel pretty smug you aren't shaking this thing.</p>
<h3>Strain</h3>
<p>This is gonna sound silly, but here it is: when I get a cocktail in a bar, and I take a sip of it, the first thing that hits me is how well strained it was -- <em>especially</em> if the drink was a) shaken and b) served up. Shaking generates tiny chips of ice, and there simply isn't a Hawthorne strainer on this Earth that will remove them. Instead, an incautiously strained drink will have a layer of ice flakes that float on top of the drink, bump against your lips as you sip, spoil the texture of the cocktail, and slowly dilute it too far.</p>
<p>Avoiding this problem is ridiculously simple:
1. Did you stir your drink? Strain by placing a Julep Spoon down in to the pint glass. Done.
2. Was the drink shaken? Place a Hawthorne strainer on top of your shaker. Now, pour the drink through a small, fine sieve. If the drink is thick -- an Alexander or a Sour, for instance -- you can speed the drinks passage through the strainer by tapping the strainer with the end of the shaker.</p>
<h3>Accessorize</h3>
<p>By now, you should have something delicious in a glass. This is good news! You're almost there. Last thing you need is to make sure the whole works is tied together. Let's talk trimmings.</p>
<p>It should be noted that many drinks don't need a damn thing, and as you make your own cocktails, you should ask about what your final addition is really <em>doing</em> for the drink. Here's a first rule: aesthetics are very important, but I prefer things that add a flavor or aroma that completes the drink. An Old Fashioned <em>without</em> a little sweet orange flavor? Not as good. On the other hand, I'll drink an un-garnished Martini. The flavor of a Sazerac is so tight and dense that I think a little citrus zest is crucial. A Remember the Maine gets cherries because they are nice to eat -- by the time you've made the drink, it should be so infused with cherry-ness that the cherries take flavor from the <em>drink</em>, not the other way around.</p>
<p>There's a word I've been trying not to say: "garnish." "Garnish" brings to mind sprigs of parsley -- little piles of dross that get added just for the visual appeal. Certainly, I've had plenty of garnished cocktails. Rum drinks, in particular, often come with "flags" of fruit -- essentially a fruit side-salad on a skewer -- that I'd be hard-pressed to say I "enjoy." The visual appeal of your drink <em>is</em> very important. My philosophy is: achieve pleasing aesthetics with good serving glasses and well-chosen <em>accoutrement</em> (straws, etc); consider garnish an ingredient, and like any other ingredient, only use what truly improves the flavor of the drink.</p>
<p>Whew. Okay. Rant done -- I feel better, thanks.</p>
<p>Let's talk about using zest: this is another place where you're going to see a thousand different techniques. There are only a couple things to make sure of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use fresh citrus.</li>
<li>Do your zesting over the drink. You'll be surprised how much citrus oil is released as you cut the fruit.</li>
<li>If you're making a fancy shape from your zest, do that over the drink, too. Always find some way to squeeze or stretch the zest over the beverage.</li>
<li>Run the zest around the edge of the glass before settling it in to the drink.</li>
</ol>
<p>How fancy you want to get with shaping/skewering/whatever-ing your zest is entirely a question of preference and aesthetics. Me? I use a sharp vegetable peeler to cut a wide swath of zest -- I find it attractive and easy to handle.</p>
<p>Last point: don't drop small things loose in to your drinks. Yes, I know, this is done all the time -- a lone cherry sitting in the bottom of your Manhattan, which was probably served in a martini glass. Personally, I can't stand having something that isn't ice rattling around in my cocktail. If the drink is served up, I don't want to choke on some loose bit of Stuff; if the drink is served over, I don't want to have to go fishing if I decide I want to eat whatever was dropped in there. The moral of this story is: put your cherry/olive/onion/candied ginger/salted plum/what-have-you on a toothpick or skewer.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>Solid technique is the cornerstone of improvisation -- as true in playing jazz as it is in dancing as it is in bartending. Firm up your technique, then see where you can go. Which whiskey do you like best in a Manhattan? Which gin is right for a Martini versus a G&amp;T? You can figure this stuff out once your technique is reliable -- and that's where making cocktails gets good.</p>
<p>Now what are you waiting for? Go make a drink!</p>
