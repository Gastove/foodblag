	<p>I'd like to take a moment to articulate two or three points of philosophy. I probably think as much as I eat, and I eat better than I cook, and I cook better than most; it should surprise you little that I think a lot about how much I like eating, and what I like to eat, and why. Turns out I also like feeding people, and dear reader, that includes you. You're not here right now. This post will have to do.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you a thing or two about how I believe people should cook and be fed.</p>
<p>Or at least, how I like best to cook, eat, and be fed. I'm a little peculiar, after all; I like a surprising amount of fat in my diet. I eat, broadly speaking, very few carbohydrates, simple or complex -- so few that it took four different very smart coaches to convince me I had to eat at least <em>some</em> carbs if I wanted to stop feeling like hell at CrossFit.<sup id="fnref:cf"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cf" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Some of my very favorite people aren't actually in love with my default mode of cooking, which tends to be... erh, rustic. Foods with a certain butter-backed fortitude. Foods for building walls and being a little ruddy with wine and laughing 'til it's hard to sit upright. Food-- well, you get the idea. Point is, I eat my way, and it will never fly to feed my food to vegans, bless 'em, or the lactose intolerant, or even vegetarians. I'm too omnivorous. Even the gluten-free are in peril.</p>
<p>The first rule is, <strong>eat in your own way</strong>. Are there ways of eating that are terribly unhealthy? Well, yes, and I wish nobody did them. Eating in your own way can be complex and a little thorny, but to paraphrase Evelyn Beatrice Hall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disapprove of what you eat, but I will defend to the death your right to eat it.<sup id="fnref:hall"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hall" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the topic of health, I'd like to touch briefly on the even more awkward point of research -- because there's a lot of it and it's a mess. I spent a while trying to (ahem) "summarize the research" for this post, and frankly: AUGH. A quick Googling on the topic of your choice will support any conclusion you'd care to come to. A traipse through Google Scholar will leave you... well, that depends on who you are, but I found it slow going. You could go <a href="http://hells-ditch.com/2012/08/archaeologists-officially-declare-collective-sigh-over-paleo-diet/">paeleo</a>, of course, or embrace the Weston A. Price appoach<sup id="fnref:weston"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:weston" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Or you could try rule number two: <strong>eat how you feel <em>best</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This is not as simple as saying it, because humans are wired with a problematic love of Absolute Crap. To celebrate this love, we've built rather a fortress of Crap between ourselves and what I'll broadly call 'good food'. This is more or less my only conviction about what, in an absolute sense, is good food: with a few exceptions, you could conceivably make it at home. And I mean <em>exactly</em> the benighted thing you're considering chewing on. There is not one person who can make a Big Mac at home, and that is for the best -- but we can most of us make a damn fine hamburger, given the want and the resources.</p>
<p>Back to Crap: my own relationship with more-or-less cutting refined sugar from my diet was not one of immediately feeling lovely. Instead, I went through something very much like withdrawal, and periodically I Jones for sugar but good. Y'know what though? I feel lovely. On a day-to-day basis I feel <em>worlds</em> better. It took some experimentation and a little time, but oh <em>man</em> has it been worth it.</p>
<p>Rule three is somewhat of a tag-along to rule two, and it goes <strong>eat how you move, move how you eat</strong>. When I'm CrossFit-ing regularly, I regularly eat four or five <em>thousand</em> calories in a day. That's pretty stupid. I mean, not stupid-stupid -- it's conceptually ridiculous to me. On Monday I ate, over the course of two meals, an entire roasted chicken. I mean, what? Correspondingly, I go run the hell around. I have a taste for goopy French cheeses and chicken liver pate; accordingly, I try to eat a diet that can sustain those things. And when I slow down, I eat less -- I listen to my stomach and if I do it carefully I can hear it say "stop, you're good." Five meals a day become three again become a weekend with only four good meals in it and some snacks.</p>
<p>There's one last rule, and it's simple: <strong>everybody deserves good food</strong>. Everybody. Your house-guests, whoever they are, however odd their diets may seem to you. Your relatives. That aunt -- the one with the "family traditions" that all involve molding food into shapes. You. Everybody. Deserves. Good. Food. I get flustered and wordless when I try and talk about how much love goes in to my cooking, but it's lots, and at the root of it is a desire to <em>nourish well this special human</em>. Food sustains you. Food motivates you. Your stomach is, in a very literal way, your <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/health/23gut.html?pagewanted=all">second brain</a>. The first brain runs on the work of the second; the second relies on materials of quality.</p>
<p>Eat like you want to live: well.</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<li>I also think its important to remember that not everybody gets to pick their diet. Eating what you'd like to -- what you'd <em>actually</em> like to -- is a privilege. This means fighting for better food for <em>everybody</em>. It also means not beating up people who don't have the privilege of dietary choice, for <em>any</em> reason.</li>
